# install docker package
sudo yum install docker -y

* docker is not an operating system.It run an OS(centos,redhat) or service(httpd) as an process
# how get the image Id and no of process running
docker ps

#To pull the image from net and run locally
docker run centos
#now run docker ps -a you will get image Id and other details(container Id, staus, port)

# how to remove a container
docker rm container id (which can be obtained by running container ps command)

container run and finish its job and than wait in thr background but it never get clean up.that why we need to remove them.
# to run the conatin 
docker run centos

#to clean automatically
docker run -rm centos 

#to check all images
docker images

# to check the default bevaious and to understand initla setup run below command
docker inspect centos/or any image name 

****************************************************
#Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. 
#A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line 
#to assemble an image. creat a file and name it Dockerfile 

vi Dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN sudo yum install httpd -y
RUN echo "hello"

#run below command
docker build .
# we can also give name to our image
docker build -t mycentos:lates .
# . means my Dockerfile is in present working directory
# now run docker images you will see mycentos there.
# put -d to let the command run in background

# contianer is not exposed to the outside world
docker run -p 80:8080 centos 
# 80 is server port on which we wre running docker
#8080 is the container port
To acess the cotianer from outsie we need its ip which can be 
# obtained via docker inspect command

#-f flag with docker build to point to a Dockerfile anywhere in your file system
#-t for tags
# -d to run in the deattached mode (in the background)



 Issues: 
 ##initlly if docker doesnot run after installation try systemctl restart docker assuning you have 
 ##already done sudo systemctl start docker and sudo systemctl enable docker
 ##
 ##in case of premission denied may be after installing dokcer you have not added the current usr to docker group
 ## first create a group dokcer and than add user to dokcer group
 sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -a -G myusername docker

if case you get issue realted with fully qualified doamin name just add -h anything.anything1.com 
e.g docker run -h stalin.mydoamin.com 

## if you contianer is getting crashed as soon as it launches you may need to specific -d option to run in deattached 
mode (in other word run in the background and keep it running)option so run continously
eg.docker run -d -h stalin.mydoamin.com stalin1
stalin1 is my image name

to run externally or to expose to outside world specifi a port option -p 
eg.docker run -d -h stalin.mydoamin.com -p 80:80 stalin1
1st 80 port my current server port i want to open
2nd 80 port my continer port i want to expose to outside
