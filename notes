# install docker package
sudo yum install docker -y

* docker is not an operating system.It run an OS(centos,redhat) or service(httpd) as an process
# how get the image Id and no of process running
docker ps

#To pull the image from net and run locally
docker run centos
#now run docker ps -a you will get image Id and other details(container Id, staus, port)

# how to remove a container
docker rm container id (which can be obtained by running container ps command)

container run and finish its job and than wait in thr background but it never get clean up.that why we need to remove them.
# to run the conatin 
docker run centos

#to clean automatically
docker run -rm centos 

#to check all images
docker images

# to check the default bevaious and to understand initla setup run below command
docker inspect centos/or any image name 

****************************************************
#Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. 
#A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line 
#to assemble an image. creat a file and name it Dockerfile 

vi Dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN sudo yum install httpd -y
RUN echo "hello"

#run below command
docker build .
# we can also give name to our image
docker build -t mycentos:lates .
# . means my Dockerfile is in present working directory
# now run docker images you will see mycentos there.
# put -d to let the command run in background

# contianer is not exposed to the outside world
docker run -p 80:8080 centos 
# 80 is server port on which we wre running docker
#8080 is the container port
To acess the cotianer from outsie we need its ip which can be 
# obtained via docker inspect command
